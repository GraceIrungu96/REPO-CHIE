# Week 1: Detailed Project Overview
This repository contains the Week 1 deliverables for the Data Engineering Internship. The core objective was to build a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that handles web-based data ingestion while ensuring strict data types and schema consistency.

###  Technical Stack
- **Environment**: WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Libraries**: Pandas, BeautifulSoup4, Requests
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub (Branch: main)

###  Deliverables
- `week_1/etl_pipeline.py`: The main logic for scraping and cleaning.
- `week_1/scraped_data_week1.csv`: The structured output ready for database injection.
