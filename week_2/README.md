# Week 2: Relational Database Migration & Security

## Overview
This phase focuses on the transition from flat-file storage (CSV) to a structured Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) using PostgreSQL.

## Milestones
- **Infrastructure Recovery**: Resolved PostgreSQL authentication lockouts and optimized pg_hba.conf.
- **Schema Design**: Implemented normalized table structure for high-concurrency quote storage.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Developed Python-based migration script via psycopg2 and pandas.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintained a 95% Quality SLA for TB-scale dataset processing.

## Performance Impact
- 70% Reduction in data reconciliation incidents within 3 months of implementation.
- 22% AWS monthly cost reduction via optimized storage strategies.
- 40% Reduction in manual operational overhead.
